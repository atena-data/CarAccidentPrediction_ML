# Salary Prediction
This project is focused on building a machine learning algorithm that predicts employee salary based on other factors such as company, degree, industryâ€¦.

## EDA and Modeling
First Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the training dataset to better understand the data and find correlating factors to salaries using Python.
In the next part, data is modeled using Linear Regression, Pipeline, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Performance of the models is then compared using MSE (Mean_Square Error and SD (Standard Deviation). 
The best model (in this case Gradient Boosting Regressor) is then applied to the target dataset to predict employee salary.
